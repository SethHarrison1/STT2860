This is stater code for using the bookdown package to write a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example.  You should edit the author field of the `index.Rmd` file and provide a link to your personal web page (if you have one).  Use the first three chapters (`01-CRchap1.Rmd`, `02-CRchap2.Rmd`, and `03-CRchap3.Rmd`) as examples for completing the remaining two chapters (`04-CRchap4.Rmd`, and `05-CRchap5.Rmd`).  Your completed **book** should look like (https://stat-ata-asu.github.io/CorrelationRegression/).
