<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Computing correlation</h2>
<p>The <code>cor(x, y)</code> function will compute the Pearson product-moment correlation between variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Since this quantity is symmetric with respect to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, it doesn’t matter in which order you put the variables.</p>
<p>At the same time, the <code>cor()</code> function is very conservative when it encounters missing data (e.g. <code>NA</code>s). The <code>use</code> argument allows you to override the default behavior of returning <code>NA</code> whenever any of the values encountered is <code>NA</code>. Setting the <code>use</code> argument to <code>"pairwise.complete.obs"</code> allows <code>cor()</code> to compute the correlation coefficient for those observations where the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are both not missing.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Exploring Anscombe</h2>
<p>In 1973, Francis Anscombe famously created four datasets with remarkably similar numerical properties, but obviously different graphic relationships. The <code>Anscombe</code> dataset contains the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates for these four datasets, along with a grouping variable, <code>set</code>, that distinguishes the quartet.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to remind yourself of the graphic relationship by viewing the four scatterplots:</p>

<h3>Perception of correlation (2)</h3>
<p>Estimating the value of the correlation coefficient between two quantities from their scatterplot can be tricky. <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj6031/f/EFS%20NSF%20206.pdf">Statisticians have shown that</a> people’s perception of the strength of these relationships can be influenced by design choices like the x and y scales.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Spurious correlation in random data</h2>
<p>Statisticians must always be skeptical of potentially spurious correlations. Human beings are very good at seeing patterns in data, sometimes when the patterns themselves are actually just random noise. To illustrate how easy it can be to fall into this trap, we will look for patterns in truly random data.</p>
<p>The noise dataset contains 20 sets of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> variables drawn at random from a standard normal distribution. Each set, denoted as <code>z</code>, has 50 observations of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> pairs. Do you see any pairs of variables that might be meaningfully correlated? Are all of the correlation coefficients close to zero?</p>
