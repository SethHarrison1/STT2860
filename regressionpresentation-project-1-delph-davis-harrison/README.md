# Correlation Regression Presentation

These are starter ioslides.  Your group is limited to seven slides (not including the cover slide).  All code, data, etc should be in the slides and reproducible.  Your talk is to be no more than 10 minutes long. Please practice your presentation so that it is polished!  Pick a data set from the [UCI machine learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) preferably dealing with regression.
